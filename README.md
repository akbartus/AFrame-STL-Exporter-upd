<img alt="Screenshot" src="img/screenshot.jpg" width="600">

### **Description / Rationale**
This is a small project, which demonstrates the working and updated version of AFrame STL Exporter Component, created by <a href="https://github.com/hassadee/aframe-stl-exporter-component">Hassadee Pimsuwan</a>, which is compatible with AFrame ver 1.3. Unfortunately latest version of the component is old and not compatible. 
This project also demonstrates the major functionality of the component, which includes:
- Exporting simple primitives (as binary and string)
- Exporting several primitives (as binary and string)
- Exporting 3D model (GLTF/GLB to binary or string).
